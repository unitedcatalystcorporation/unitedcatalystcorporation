				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Converter IDentification<br />

<p class="MsoNormal">Converters are not just<br />
another core. They are a precious metals commodity. These are the metals that<br />
should be sold after processing and refining so that the true end-of-life value<br />
of the converter can be revealed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It takes a leading<br />
expert in both processing and refining to manage an assay-based catalytic<br />
converter recycling program.&nbsp;United Catalyst Corporation offers recyclers<br />
20 years expertise in both areas. Scientifically accurate and reliable results<br />
every time from a leading global refiner, assay-based selling can effectively<br />
eliminate grading and pricing issues associated with selling converters by the<br />
piece.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">United Catalyst Corporation<br />
is an independent processor of scrap catalytic converters and converter testing<br />
facility. The company is the creator of Converter IDentification (CID)<br />
Systems™, a partnership with North American recyclers and converter manufacturers,<br />
to process, test, and refine all scrap catalytic converters by make/model and<br />
VIN, returning true value for this commodity to the recycler. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Know true converter values.<br />
Become a recycling partner with United Catalyst Corporation and reap the benefits<br />
of Converter IDentification (CID) Systems™. It’s your commodity, learn to<br />
manage it. </p>
