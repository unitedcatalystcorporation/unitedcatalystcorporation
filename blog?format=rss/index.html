(CID) Systems™ is helping recyclers get what they want from their scrap
catalytic converters – data in hand and cash in the drawer. Know the value of
the converter by make/model and VIN upfront before you buy the car or cat. Get
paid how you need to – when you need to – without compromising full value. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Converters are not just
another core. They are a precious metals commodity. These are the metals that
should be sold after processing and refining so that the true end-of-life value
of the converter can be revealed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It takes a leading
expert in both processing and refining to manage an assay-based catalytic
converter recycling program.&nbsp;United Catalyst Corporation offers recyclers
20 years expertise in both areas. Scientifically accurate and reliable results
every time from a leading global refiner, assay-based selling can effectively
eliminate grading and pricing issues associated with selling converters by the
piece.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">United Catalyst Corporation
is an independent processor of scrap catalytic converters and converter testing
facility. The company is the creator of Converter IDentification (CID)
Systems™, a partnership with North American recyclers and converter manufacturers,
to process, test, and refine all scrap catalytic converters by make/model and
VIN, returning true value for this commodity to the recycler. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Know true converter values.
Become a recycling partner with United Catalyst Corporation and reap the benefits
of Converter IDentification (CID) Systems™. It’s your commodity, learn to
manage it. </p>
